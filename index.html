                    <center>Green Lines</center>
                </h2>The green lines represent the varsity swim teams trips to their fall
                international dual meet. <br> Last
                year,
                the
                University of Toronto
                travelled to Las Vegas, Nevada to compete against the Unviersity of Nevada. This past fall, the team
                travelled
                to New York City where the men competed against Columbia University and the women competed against
                Rutgers
                University. <br> These trips are a sepcial opportunity for the team to experience university
                swimming in
                a
                different country and compete against new swimmers.

                <h2>
                    <center>Orange Lines</center>
                </h2>The orange lines represent the teams trips to their week long training camps. <br> In the
                2022-23
                season,
                the
                team flew to Barbados for a little more than a week on New Year's day. This year, the team travelled
                to
                Fort-Lauderdale, Florida during the fall reading week. <br>Training camps are crucial periods of
                training
                where
                swimmers can focus on training hard. But they are also crucial times of team bonding in the sun and
                at
                the
                beach.

                    <center>Purple Lines</center>
                </h2>The purple lines represent the teams trip to the OUA Championship meets. <br> These meets are
                hosted by
                universities within Ontario, as the OUA Championship meet is the Ontario Provincial University
                Championship
                meet. The University of Toronto hosted the OUA Championship meet in 2022, whereas Western University
                hosted
                it
                2023 and Brock Univeristy will host it this year. <br> The University of Toronto's womens team has
                won
                the
                OUA
                Championship every year since 2014 while the mens team has won every year since 2004.

                    <center>Blue Lines</center>
                </h2>The dark blue lines represent where I traveled to, or am going to travel to, to compete at the
                USports
                Championship swim meet, as part of the varsity swim team at
                the University of Toronto. <br> Last year,
                Usports were in Victoria, BC, hosted by the University of Victoria. And the year before that they
                were
                at
                Laval
                University in Quebec City. This year
                they are hosted by McGill University in Pointe-Claire, Montreal. <br> Usports Championships are the
                biggest
                swim
                meet of our
                season. It's
                where every university in Canada competes for the National title. University of Toronto has won the
                past two years, and we are hoping to win it for a third time in a couple of weeks.</p>
